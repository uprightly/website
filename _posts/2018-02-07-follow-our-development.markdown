In an effort to be as transparent as possible, we are making our code open source right from the beginning! Our development process is wide open for anybody to watch (and participate if you so desire!)

[Follow along on Github](https://www.github.com/uprightly)

Every day we are working toward reaching our roadmap goals. We have not yet launched our ICO, but even without funding we are striving to deliver a useful product.

If you have any questions, feel free to join us in our Slack chat!

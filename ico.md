# ICO information

UPT (Uprightly Protocol Token) is an ERC20 token based on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## What address do I send ETH to?

Address: Coming soon.

Video verification of the address: Coming soon.

## What are the dates within which I can contribute?

February 15th, 2018 until March 15th, 2018. To be sure, check this website. We will announce when the offering officially begins and ends.

## When will I get my tokens?

Immediately after the end of the offering period.

## How many tokens will I get?

The amount of tokens each contributor will receive depends on how much they contribute and how much others contribute. We will split 500,000,000 tokens proportionally amongst all contributors. For example, if 10,000 ETH total is contributed, and a particular contributor sent 3 ETH, that contributor would receive 150,000 tokens (3 / 10000 * 500000000).

## Are there any incentives for being an early contributor?

No. All contributions will be treated equally. We want the offering to be an honest affair without creating a frenzy. We do not want people to miss out or be pushed out by bigger contributors. The success of the project is what is most important, thus it is critical that the tokens are distributed widely to many market participants.

## Will there be ample time to review the contract code?

Yes. The offering will last a month, giving enough time for code inspection. We will also release the code and publish the contract address before the offering begins so people can inspect the code beforehand as well.

We will use OpenZeppelin's contracts for CrowdSales and Tokens. These are perhaps the most-secure, well-audited contracts in the ecosystem today.
